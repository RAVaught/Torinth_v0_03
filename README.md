Rebuild of Torinth

**NOTE**This project is a reboot of Torinth - Dynamic Worlds. It was started because of massive overhauls to the UE4 game engine
that were making code maintenance difficult as we moved forward. 

Project Overview

The ultimate design goals of the game are rather straight forward: Everything must change and grow. The age of static game worlds
is over. We are not trying to create a cinematic experience, but rather an experience where the player can shape the story of 
the world through their actions with meaningful choices.


Component Rework

This branch is dedicated to reworking the original systems into modular components that can be used and reused.
